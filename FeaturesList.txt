Type Inference for method variables.

G1GC performance imporvements.
	G1GC divides heap into small cells can be eden space (for new objects), suvivour space(for slightly longer lived objects) or old space (very long lived object)
	It can do incremental GC. Selects subset of the heap to GC which results in lower GC pauses.
	It can also do parallel marking.
	It is well suited for large heaps.
	We can predefine pause time goal.
	Slightly more memory intensive.
	Full GC has been changed to run in parallel mode.
	
Improved container awareness.
	JVM is now aware of the container and will query the container for available CPU's and memory.



Deprecations:
	java.security.acl instead use java.security
	java.security.{Certificate, Identity, IdentityScope, Singer}
	javax.security.auth.Policy --> use java.security.Policy

Removals:
	Removed command line tool javah --> use javac -h <dir> instead
	Removed policy tool
	Removed -X:prof --> use jmap instead or any other 3rd party profilers
